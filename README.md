Hi, my name is Patrick and I am an intermediate python developer. I started my Python journey around ten months ago (January 2022) with a basic Python class that piqued my interest. Now, I work on real-world projects that involve API usage and data collection.

I plan to learn other languages like JavaScript and C sometime in the near future, too.
